## Setup and Installation Requirements

### Prior to Installation

#### Confirm you have Git installed

  * Installing Git on Macs:
    * Install the package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by copying and pasting the following in the terminal: ```$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```
    * Copy and paste once of the following lines in the terminal so that Homebrew packages are run before the system versions of the same packages:
      * For bash users: ```$ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile```
      * For zsh users: ```$ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc```
    * Last, install Git with the following terminal command: ```$ brew install git```

  * Installing Git on Windows:
    * Open Command Prompt, the Windows terminal program. You can access it by typing ```Cmd``` in the search bar in the bottom left corner.
    * **NOTE** There are many options available, but we recommend using a free program called [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
    * Navigate to [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) and click on the Download button. This will take you to a page with the latest version of Git Bash. Determine whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows by following these instructions. Then download the corresponding exe file from the Git for Windows site. (If you have a package manager already installed, you can also choose to download the tar.bz2 version.)
    * Click on the downloaded file and then follow the instructions in the Setup menu until you reach the Install button and install the package.

#### Confirm you have Node.js and npm installed

* Confirm you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Installation

#### Clone

* Clone the repository with the following git terminal command: ```$ git clone https://github.com/chloeloveall/booch-shine.git```
* Open the project's root directory (```booch-shine```) in your terminal

#### Download

* Open the repository on GitHub: [chloeloveall/booch-shine](https://github.com/chloeloveall/booch-shine)
* Click ```Code``` button and select ```Download ZIP```
* Open and extract the files
* Open [VSCode], or your code editor of choice
* Select ```File>Open...``` and navigate to the unzipped file folder 
* Select ```booch-shine``` and click ```open``` to view the project

### Launching the program

* Navigate to the root directory (```booch-shine/```) and install required dependencies by running the following terminal command: ```npm install```
* You are now ready to run the program! From the root directory, run the following terminal command: ```npm start```
* In the browser of your choice, navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can???t go back!**

If you aren???t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you???re on your own.

You don???t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn???t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn???t be useful if you couldn???t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available hard kombucha kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price, alcoholContent, and flavor.
* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new hard kombucha to a list.
* As a user, I want to be able to click on a specific hard kombucha to see its detail page.
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a specific hard kombucha keg. 
* As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
* As a user, I want the option to edit a hard kombucha keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
